> Chrome extension for code highlighting raw logs in GItlab CI

If you have large logs Gitlab will show only part for it. Gitlab has a link to the full log but it's completely unusable due of lack ANSI code highlight and text formatting. This extension parses ANSI codes and shows your's full logs with code highlights.

It works with self-hosted Gitlab instances for links like http://[your-gitlab-hostname]/[path-to-project]/-/jobs/[job-number]/raw and with gitlab.com
